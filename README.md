# Task 1
# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains the code and visualizations for the task of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) performed on a dataset using Python libraries like pandas,matplotlib and seaborn.

## Task Description
The goal of this task is to explore the characteristics, distributions, correlations, and outliers present in a dataset. I gained insights into the data through visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is [provide_dataset_name_here]. (Add a brief description of the dataset, including its source and any relevant details.)

- **code.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for EDA.
- **visualizations/**: Directory containing visualizations generated during the analysis.
  - *histograms.png*: Histograms showing the distribution of population over time.
  - *scatter_plots.png*: Scatter plots showing the relationship between different population years.
  - *heatmap.png*: Heatmap showing the correlation between population years.

## Dependencies
